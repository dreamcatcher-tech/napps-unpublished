## Stuck ID & Name

- **ID**: S24
- **Name**: deliver-the-trucking-app

## Rationale

Urgent client need for a trucking solution delivers near-term revenue and
establishes credibility, taking advantage of rapid AI-driven development.

## Description

Build and deliver a functional trucking app quickly, meeting the clientâ€™s
operational needs and generating immediate value.

## Context & References

- **Transcripts**: Urgent need for near-term revenue (6:35, 14:40, 15:50, 26:09,
  28:16).
- **Domains/Definitions**: Integrates with existing data flows and possibly CRM
  elements.
- **External References**: Logistics software best practices.

## Dependencies

- **Stuck Dependencies**: NApp format (S8) and QA processes (S38) help ensure
  quality.
- **Resource/Domain Dependencies**: Stable dev pipeline, AI code generation
  tools.

## Desired Outcome (Definition of Done)

Trucking app delivered, functional, client satisfied, generating revenue. Tests
confirm reliability, performance, and user acceptance.

## QA/Evals

- **Tests & Verifications**:
  - Feature tests against client specs.
- **Metrics for Success**:
  - Client satisfaction, app stability, initial revenue generated.

## Tasks & Key Functionalities

- **Subtasks**:
  1. Implement core logistics features (scheduling, tracking)
  2. UI/UX integration
  3. Test and refine until client approval
- **Capabilities Needed**: Rapid AI-driven coding, stable QA.

## Constraints & Risks

- **Known Limitations**: Time-sensitive delivery.
- **Potential Risks**: Changing client requirements after delivery.

## Progress & Effort

- **Effort Expended**: Planning phase.
- **Future Estimate**: Few sprints with AI assistance.
- **Current Status**: Ready for development start.

## Next Steps & Recommendations

Begin coding immediately, prioritize stable basics, iterate after initial
delivery.

# S25-develop-commander-ai-for-complexity-management.md

## Stuck ID & Name

- **ID**: S25
- **Name**: develop-commander-ai-for-complexity-management

## Rationale

With rapid code generation, complexity is the new bottleneck. A Commander AI can
manage tasks, data, and reasoning, reducing confusion and enhancing scalability.

## Description

Implement a Commander AI to structure projects, allocate resources, and guide
decisions, turning chaos into coherent action plans.

## Context & References

- **Transcripts**: Complexity and need for Commander (19:30, 23:01, 24:05).
- **Domains/Definitions**: Relies on structured stucks and knowledge mapping.
- **External References**: Project management AIs.

## Dependencies

- **Stuck Dependencies**: S27 (robust task structure), S8 (NApp format), S28
  (unify repos).
- **Resource/Domain Dependencies**: Stable schemas, domain definitions.

## Desired Outcome (Definition of Done)

Commander AI operational, managing complexity efficiently, validated by improved
decision-making and reduced confusion in planning.

## QA/Evals

- **Tests & Verifications**:
  - Check Commanderâ€™s handling of multiple tasks.
  - Evaluate decision quality and user feedback.
- **Metrics for Success**:
  - Reduced confusion, better forecasting.

## Tasks & Key Functionalities

- **Subtasks**:
  1. Complexity analysis modules
  2. Dependency resolution
  3. Progress tracking interface
- **Capabilities Needed**: Reasoning algorithms, knowledge structures.

## Constraints & Risks

- **Known Limitations**: Needs stable schemas and data structures.
- **Potential Risks**: Tuning complexity as project scales.

## Progress & Effort

- **Effort Expended**: Conceptual design only.
- **Future Estimate**: Several sprints for MVP.
- **Current Status**: Preliminary planning.

## Next Steps & Recommendations

Start foundational work after initial trucking app delivery, refine Commander
capabilities incrementally.

_(Already provided as an example, repeating for completeness)_

## Stuck ID & Name

- **ID**: S14
- **Name**: stuck-graph-visualization

## Rationale

Visualizing stuck dependencies helps teams understand complexity, identify
bottlenecks, and improve decision-making.

## Description

Render stucks and their dependencies as an interactive graph for better
comprehension of relationships and dependencies.

## Context & References

- **Transcripts**: General need for visualization.
- **Domains/Definitions**: Requires stuck structure (S16) and dependency data
  (S32).
- **External References**: Graph visualization libraries.

## Dependencies

- **Stuck Dependencies**: S16, S32 for stable structure and mapping.
- **Resource/Domain Dependencies**: Accessible dependency metadata.

## Desired Outcome (Definition of Done)

An interactive graph showing stuck nodes, edges as dependencies, with tests
confirming accuracy and usability.

## QA/Evals

- **Tests & Verifications**: Load tests, correctness checks against known
  dependencies.
- **Metrics for Success**: Positive user feedback on clarity, fast rendering.

## Tasks & Key Functionalities

- **Subtasks**:
  1. Data extraction for stuck/dependencies
  2. Graph rendering integration
  3. Interactivity (tooltips, zoom)
- **Capabilities Needed**: Graph library, stable data access.

## Constraints & Risks

- **Known Limitations**: Performance for large graphs.
- **Potential Risks**: Dense graphs requiring filtering later.

## Progress & Effort

- **Effort Expended**: Conceptual only.
- **Future Estimate**: 1-2 sprints after data stable.
- **Current Status**: Planning.

## Next Steps & Recommendations

Wait for stuck structure & dependency mapping, implement a prototype, gather
feedback.

# S33-define-and-assign-stucks-as-tasks.md

## Stuck ID & Name

- **ID**: S33
- **Name**: define-and-assign-stucks-as-tasks

## Rationale

Using "stucks" as a uniform concept for all tasks simplifies management,
automation, and planning. A unified naming/format reduces confusion.

## Description

Treat all tasks as "stucks," formalizing their use and ensuring a single
conceptual model for project activities.

## Context & References

- **Transcripts**: (20:02, 25:02) mention simplifying task definitions.
- **Domains/Definitions**: Stuck schema (S16) critical here.
- **External References**: Standard task management principles.

## Dependencies

- **Stuck Dependencies**: S16 (formal stuck schema) to ensure consistency.
- **Resource/Domain Dependencies**: Knowledge that all tasks can be represented
  as stucks.

## Desired Outcome (Definition of Done)

All tasks use stuck definition format, tested by uniform usage, no separate task
concepts causing confusion, and Commander integration.

## QA/Evals

- **Tests & Verifications**:
  - Convert existing tasks into stucks, check no loss of info.
- **Metrics for Success**:
  - All team members find stuck format intuitive, no more ad-hoc task
    definitions.

## Tasks & Key Functionalities

- **Subtasks**:
  1. Document guidelines for using stucks as tasks
  2. Convert existing tasks to stuck format
- **Capabilities Needed**: Documentation, schema application.

## Constraints & Risks

- **Known Limitations**: Might require retraining team habits.
- **Potential Risks**: Minor initial confusion during transition.

## Progress & Effort

- **Effort Expended**: Concept ready.
- **Future Estimate**: <1 sprint to standardize once schema ready.
- **Current Status**: Awaiting dependencies.

## Next Steps & Recommendations

Define stuck format clearly (S16), then adopt stuck concept for all tasks, train
team accordingly.

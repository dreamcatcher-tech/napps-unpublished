# S29-deploy-and-integrate-concat-tool.md

## Stuck ID & Name

- **ID**: S29
- **Name**: deploy-and-integrate-concat-tool

## Rationale

Managing large context windows manually is tough. The concat tool creates
condensed summaries of domain files, improving O1 Pro’s reasoning efficiency and
reducing token usage.

## Description

Deploy the concat tool to summarize domain files, integrate it into workflows so
that O1 Pro can access clearer, more concise contexts.

## Context & References

- **Transcripts**: (45:50–46:40) hint at improving context management.
- **Domains/Definitions**: Ties into domain definitions and commander's
  knowledge structures.
- **External References**: Summarization techniques, text processing tools.

## Dependencies

- **Stuck Dependencies**: S28 (unified repo) ensures all files accessible.
- **Resource/Domain Dependencies**: Stable domain definitions and file
  structures.

## Desired Outcome (Definition of Done)

Concat tool deployed, providing reliable summaries on-demand. Tests confirm O1
Pro reasoning improves with these summaries, measured by reduced token usage and
quicker solution times.

## QA/Evals

- **Tests & Verifications**:
  - Test concat tool on sample files.
  - Check O1 Pro performance with/without summaries.
- **Metrics for Success**:
  - Measurable reduction in tokens used, faster O1 Pro responses.

## Tasks & Key Functionalities

- **Subtasks**:
  1. Integrate concat tool in workflow
  2. Generate summaries for key domains
  3. Evaluate O1 Pro improvements
- **Capabilities Needed**: File scanning, text summarization logic.

## Constraints & Risks

- **Known Limitations**: Depends on stable knowledge structures.
- **Potential Risks**: Summary quality may vary; tuning needed.

## Progress & Effort

- **Effort Expended**: Tool concept known, needs deployment.
- **Future Estimate**: <1 sprint once environment ready.
- **Current Status**: Awaiting stable environment.

## Next Steps & Recommendations

Deploy after Commander (S25) and knowledge structures (S26) are in place, test
on sample files, iterate as needed.

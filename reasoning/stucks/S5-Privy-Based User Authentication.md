## Stuck ID & Name

- **ID**: S5
- **Name**: privy-based-user-authentication

## Rationale

Secures access to sensitive CRM data by replacing basic auth with Privy,
ensuring proper user authentication and identity management.

## Description

Integrate Privy for user login, enforcing that only authenticated users can view
CRM data, enhancing security and compliance.

## Context & References

- **Transcripts**: Security concerns raised as data grows sensitive.
- **Domains/Definitions**: Auth-related domains.
- **External References**: Privy documentation and identity frameworks.

## Dependencies

- **Stuck Dependencies**: None specific, but stable UI and data environment
  helps.
- **Resource/Domain Dependencies**: Need stable front-end integration.

## Desired Outcome (Definition of Done)

Users must authenticate via Privy to access CRM data, unauthorized access is
blocked, and login flow is smooth.

## QA/Evals

- **Tests & Verifications**: Test login flow, ensure unauthorized users canâ€™t
  see data.
- **Metrics for Success**: 100% rejection of unauthenticated requests, seamless
  login UX.

## Tasks & Key Functionalities

- **Subtasks**:
  1. Integrate Privy login form
  2. Token/session handling
  3. Validate permissions on data requests
- **Capabilities Needed**: Auth token management, secure session handling.

## Constraints & Risks

- **Known Limitations**: Requires stable Privy integration.
- **Potential Risks**: None identified yet.

## Progress & Effort

- **Effort Expended**: Reviewed Privy docs.
- **Future Estimate**: <1 sprint if integration is straightforward.
- **Current Status**: Planning.

## Next Steps & Recommendations

Implement Privy login flow in dev environment, test thoroughly, then deploy once
stable.

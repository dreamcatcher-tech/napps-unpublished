# S13-local-to-cloud-napp-sync.md

## Stuck ID & Name

- **ID**: S13
- **Name**: local-to-cloud-napp-sync

## Rationale

Supports hybrid architectures by syncing local NApps with cloud Artifact,
ensuring data consistency and edge computing scenarios.

## Description

Allow secure push/pull of data between local NApps and cloud Artifact,
maintaining up-to-date states.

## Context & References

- **Transcripts**: Implied need for hybrid approaches.
- **Domains/Definitions**: Artifact data handling.
- **External References**: Sync patterns (push/pull).

## Dependencies

- **Stuck Dependencies**: S1 for Git-based artifact storage, possibly S5/S6 for
  auth.
- **Resource/Domain Dependencies**: Networked sync protocols.

## Desired Outcome (Definition of Done)

Smooth data flow between local and cloud, verified by sync tests ensuring
integrity.

## QA/Evals

- **Tests & Verifications**: Local→cloud and cloud→local sync tests.
- **Metrics for Success**: No data loss, seamless updates.

## Tasks & Key Functionalities

- **Subtasks**:
  1. Implement pull-only sync
  2. Add bi-directional sync
- **Capabilities Needed**: Authenticated APIs, version tracking.

## Constraints & Risks

- **Known Limitations**: Needs stable auth layers.
- **Potential Risks**: Conflict resolution complexity.

## Progress & Effort

- **Effort Expended**: Basic planning.
- **Future Estimate**: Several sprints.
- **Current Status**: Conceptual only.

## Next Steps & Recommendations

Start with one-way sync, then refine and add bi-directional capabilities.

# S31-allocate-resources-based-on-value-units.md

## Stuck ID & Name

- **ID**: S31
- **Name**: allocate-resources-based-on-value-units

## Rationale

Introducing "value units" to quantify task importance ensures rational resource
allocation, focusing on high-impact tasks first.

## Description

Assign value units (tokens) to tasks, prioritizing those with higher strategic
importance. Commander uses these units to guide resource distribution
effectively.

## Context & References

- **Transcripts**: (32:49) suggests a token-based or metric-driven priority
  system.
- **Domains/Definitions**: Ties into Commander decision-making.
- **External References**: Weighted prioritization techniques.

## Dependencies

- **Stuck Dependencies**: S25 (Commander) to leverage these metrics.
- **Resource/Domain Dependencies**: Stable stuck definitions to assign values.

## Desired Outcome (Definition of Done)

A system that ranks tasks by assigned value units, proven to optimize task
selection, confirmed by test scenarios showing improved strategic outcomes.

## QA/Evals

- **Tests & Verifications**:
  - Assign values to sample tasks, verify Commander chooses highest-value tasks
    first.
- **Metrics for Success**:
  - Better strategic outcomes, feedback from team on improved focus.

## Tasks & Key Functionalities

- **Subtasks**:
  1. Define a mechanism to assign value units
  2. Integrate unit-based ranking in Commander logic
- **Capabilities Needed**: Data structure for value units, sorting by priority
  metric.

## Constraints & Risks

- **Known Limitations**: Requires stable Commander environment.
- **Potential Risks**: Tuning value assignment criteria as strategy evolves.

## Progress & Effort

- **Effort Expended**: Conceptual only.
- **Future Estimate**: 1 sprint after Commander stable.
- **Current Status**: Awaiting foundation.

## Next Steps & Recommendations

Implement once Commander can utilize these metrics, start with a simple
weighting system, refine over time.

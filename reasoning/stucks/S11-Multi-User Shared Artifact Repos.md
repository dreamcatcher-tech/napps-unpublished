# S11-multi-user-shared-artifact-repos.md

## Stuck ID & Name

- **ID**: S11
- **Name**: multi-user-shared-artifact-repos

## Rationale

Enables team collaboration on Artifact data, scaling platform usage for multiple
contributors.

## Description

Allow multiple users to access and contribute to the same Artifact repo,
supporting branching, merging, permissions, and conflict resolution.

## Context & References

- **Transcripts**: Needed for team scenarios.
- **Domains/Definitions**: Builds on `artifact.md`.
- **External References**: Git multi-user workflows.

## Dependencies

- **Stuck Dependencies**: S1 for Git-based data.
- **Resource/Domain Dependencies**: Permission system, concurrency handling.

## Desired Outcome (Definition of Done)

Smooth multi-user collaboration with no data corruption, tested by concurrent
edits and merges.

## QA/Evals

- **Tests & Verifications**: Multiple user commit tests, conflict resolution
  scenarios.
- **Metrics for Success**: Successful merges, stable multi-user flows.

## Tasks & Key Functionalities

- **Subtasks**:
  1. Implement permissions
  2. Branch/merge workflows
- **Capabilities Needed**: Access control, conflict resolution tools.

## Constraints & Risks

- **Known Limitations**: Complex conflicts.
- **Potential Risks**: Performance under concurrency.

## Progress & Effort

- **Effort Expended**: Conceptual planning.
- **Future Estimate**: Several sprints.
- **Current Status**: Ideas only.

## Next Steps & Recommendations

Start read-only shared repos, then add write and merging, test incrementally.

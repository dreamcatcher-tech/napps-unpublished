## Stuck ID & Name

- **ID**: S23
- **Name**: ui-based-billing-integration

## Rationale

Eventually tracking token usage/costs in the UI supports monetization and
transparent billing, essential for a sustainable business model.

## Description

Add a billing dashboard in the UI to show usage metrics, costs, and payment
methods, preparing for future revenue streams.

## Context & References

- **Transcripts**: Monetization considered as future scenario.
- **Domains/Definitions**: Payment and usage metrics domains.
- **External References**: Payment gateway APIs, invoicing standards.

## Dependencies

- **Stuck Dependencies**: Stabilized code and usage metrics, possibly Commander
  insights.
- **Resource/Domain Dependencies**: Payment provider integration, stable metrics
  collection.

## Desired Outcome (Definition of Done)

A UI dashboard displays usage, costs, and invoices. Tests confirm correct cost
calculations and secure payment flows.

## QA/Evals

- **Tests & Verifications**:
  - Test with mock accounts, validate cost accuracy.
- **Metrics for Success**:
  - Users can understand their costs easily, no billing errors.

## Tasks & Key Functionalities

- **Subtasks**:
  1. Integrate billing API
  2. Show usage metrics and invoices in UI
  3. Test with sample billing scenarios
- **Capabilities Needed**: Payment integration, UI design for financial data.

## Constraints & Risks

- **Known Limitations**: Not needed until actual demand arises.
- **Potential Risks**: Currency conversions, regulatory compliance.

## Progress & Effort

- **Effort Expended**: None yet, deferred.
- **Future Estimate**: Multiple sprints when needed.
- **Current Status**: None, waiting on need.

## Next Steps & Recommendations

Defer until there's demand, then evaluate payment providers and UI design.

# S1-git-based-artifact-database.md

## Stuck ID & Name

- **ID**: S1
- **Name**: git-based-artifact-database

## Rationale

Foundational for trust, versioning, and a developer-friendly workflow. Ensures
auditability, rollback, and branching of Artifact data, critical for long-term
integrity.

## Description

Replace the traditional database with Git-based storage, allowing deterministic,
auditable changes and collaborative workflows.

## Context & References

- **Transcripts**: Discussed early as a foundational step.
- **Domains/Definitions**: `domains/innovation/artifact.md`
- **External References**: Git operations, VCS best practices.

## Dependencies

- **Stuck Dependencies**: None initially.
- **Resource/Domain Dependencies**: Git integration layer, possibly NApp format
  (S8).

## Desired Outcome (Definition of Done)

Artifact data fully managed in Git commits/branches, passing integrity tests,
supporting rollback without data loss.

## QA/Evals

- **Tests & Verifications**: Commit/branch integrity, read/write ops validation,
  revert tests.
- **Metrics for Success**: 100% integrity test pass, seamless version retrieval.

## Tasks & Key Functionalities

- **Subtasks**:
  1. Implement Git commit on write
  2. Git checkout on read
  3. Branch/merge support
- **Capabilities Needed**: Git integration, data-to-commit formatting.

## Constraints & Risks

- **Known Limitations**: Requires stable Git integration.
- **Potential Risks**: Performance with large datasets.

## Progress & Effort

- **Effort Expended**: Some Git API exploration.
- **Future Estimate**: 1-2 sprints.
- **Current Status**: Planning (prototype pending).

## Next Steps & Recommendations

Implement a proof-of-concept on small datasets, then refine and scale.

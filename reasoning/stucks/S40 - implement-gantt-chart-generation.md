# S40 - implement-gantt-chart-generation

## Priority & Rationale

**Priority**: Medium-High\
**Rationale**: Visualizing stuck dependencies via Gantt charts enhances
strategic planning and complexity management, supporting the Commander’s
decision-making process. It aids in identifying critical paths, scheduling tasks
efficiently, and improving transparency for stakeholders.

## Description

Create an automated system (likely a NApp) that generates Gantt charts from the
existing stuck dependency graph. The charts should provide a timeline view,
dependencies, start/end estimates, and highlight critical paths, enabling more
informed prioritization and sequencing.

## Context & References

- **Transcripts**:
  - Refers to recent discussions (e.g., 2024-12-20 project management first
    stucks review) that emphasize the need for better visualization and planning
    tools.
- **Domains/Definitions**:
  - Related to tasks in `domains/innovation/stuck.md` and
    `domains/innovation/stuck-loop-process.md`.
- **External References**:
  - Standard Gantt chart methodologies, existing project management tools as
    conceptual inspiration.

## Dependencies

- **Stuck Dependencies**:
  - S32 (Map Tasks, Dependencies, and Risks) should be completed first to have a
    reliable dependency graph.
  - S27 (Robust Task ("Stuck") Structure) ensures consistent task definition,
    making chart generation meaningful.
- **Resource/Domain Dependencies**:
  - Requires consolidated stuck data in a structured format, likely from the
    Commander’s knowledge repository or Artifact storage.

## Desired Outcome (Definition of Done)

- A generated Gantt chart that:
  1. Automatically reads stuck dependencies and timelines.
  2. Displays tasks with start/end estimates.
  3. Highlights critical paths and dependencies clearly.
  4. Is easily accessible (e.g., a command to generate a current chart).
- Confirmed by QA that charts accurately reflect stuck states and update
  dynamically as stucks evolve.

## QA/Evals

- **Tests & Verifications**:
  - Mock scenarios: Introduce sample stuck sets and verify correct chart
    rendering.
  - Check that adding or removing a stuck updates the Gantt chart accordingly.
  - Validate start/end date logic and critical path identification against test
    cases.
- **Metrics for Success**:
  - Accuracy in reflecting current stuck states (no missing dependencies).
  - Ease of interpretation for stakeholders (feedback from at least one user
    review).

## Tasks & Key Functionalities

- **Subtasks**:
  1. Implement a parser to read stuck dependency data.
  2. Create a timeline calculation module (start/end estimates).
  3. Integrate a Gantt chart rendering engine (could be text-based or
     graphical).
  4. Add a CLI or NApp interface to generate and view charts.
  5. Test with sample data and adjust formatting for clarity.
- **Capabilities Needed**:
  - Data retrieval from Commander or stuck repository.
  - Dependency graph processing.
  - Timeline and path calculations.

## Constraints & Risks

- **Known Limitations**:
  - Without reliable estimates on tasks, Gantt charts may be approximate.
  - Initial version may be simplistic (e.g., no advanced UI).
- **Potential Risks**:
  - Complexity in handling dynamic updates if stuck priorities or dependencies
    shift frequently.
  - Scaling issues if the number of stucks grows large.

## Progress & Effort

- **Effort Expended**:
  - None yet; concept stage.
- **Future Estimate**:
  - Approximately 1 sprint (2 weeks) for a basic prototype.
- **Current Status**:
  - “Planned”: awaiting completion of dependency mapping (S32) and a stable
    stuck structure.

## Next Steps & Recommendations

- Complete S32 to ensure dependency data is ready.
- Implement a simple prototype with a small test dataset.
- Gather feedback from stakeholders (Commander users) to refine chart layout and
  detail level.

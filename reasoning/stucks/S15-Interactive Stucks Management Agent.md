# S15-interactive-stucks-management-agent.md

## Stuck ID & Name

- **ID**: S15
- **Name**: interactive-stucks-management-agent

## Rationale

A conversational interface simplifies stuck management, enabling users to
add/remove/modify stucks via natural language commands, reducing manual editing
overhead.

## Description

Implement an agent that responds to user chat commands to update stuck
definitions or dependencies, streamlining complexity management as the project
grows.

## Context & References

- **Transcripts**: Increasing complexity noted, need for easier stuck
  adjustments mentioned in discussions.
- **Domains/Definitions**: Stuck schema (S16) must be stable for smooth updates.
- **External References**: NLP interfaces, conversational agents.

## Dependencies

- **Stuck Dependencies**: S16 (Formal Stuck Schema) for consistent updates.
- **Resource/Domain Dependencies**: NLP tools and stable stuck storage backend.

## Desired Outcome (Definition of Done)

Users can chat with the agent to accurately update stuck fields, link stucks, or
remove them. Tests verify correctness and minimal confusion in commands.

## QA/Evals

- **Tests & Verifications**:
  - Issue user commands to add/remove stucks.
  - Validate stuck data matches instructions.
- **Metrics for Success**:
  - High accuracy in interpreting commands.
  - Reduced manual stuck editing.

## Tasks & Key Functionalities

- **Subtasks**:
  1. NLP integration for command parsing
  2. Stuck CRUD operations via API
  3. Logging and validation steps
- **Capabilities Needed**: NLP parsing, schema validation, stuck API
  integration.

## Constraints & Risks

- **Known Limitations**: Agent accuracy depends on NLP quality.
- **Potential Risks**: Ambiguous user commands might cause incorrect updates.

## Progress & Effort

- **Effort Expended**: Concept stage only.
- **Future Estimate**: Several sprints post-schema finalization.
- **Current Status**: None.

## Next Steps & Recommendations

Finalize stuck schema (S16), then implement a simple agent and refine with user
feedback.

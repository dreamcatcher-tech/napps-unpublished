## Stuck ID & Name

- **ID**: S36
- **Name**: prioritize-and-deliver-the-trucking-app-using-ai-capabilities

## Rationale

Similar to S24, but now leveraging improved AI pipeline for faster, cheaper
delivery, securing near-term revenue even more efficiently.

## Description

Use enhanced AI-driven coding and tooling to deliver the trucking app with
greater speed and lower overhead, meeting or exceeding previous delivery
timescales.

## Context & References

- **Transcripts**: (20:02, 55:02, 56:09) indicate improved AI pipeline.
- **Domains/Definitions**: Ties into Commander and O1 Pro integration.
- **External References**: Advanced automation in software delivery.

## Dependencies

- **Stuck Dependencies**: S24 for trucking app concept, plus stable AI pipeline
  from previous stucks.
- **Resource/Domain Dependencies**: QA and automated code generation stable.

## Desired Outcome (Definition of Done)

Trucking app delivered faster than before using advanced AI tools, client happy,
revenue generated. Tests confirm no quality regressions.

## QA/Evals

- **Tests & Verifications**:
  - Compare delivery speed, cost, and quality to previous attempts.
- **Metrics for Success**:
  - Shorter delivery time, client satisfaction.

## Tasks & Key Functionalities

- **Subtasks**:
  1. Leverage AI pipeline for coding core features
  2. Integrate QA checks
  3. Deliver to client, gather feedback
- **Capabilities Needed**: Automated code generation, QA integration.

## Constraints & Risks

- **Known Limitations**: Relies on established pipeline and previous learnings
  from S24.
- **Potential Risks**: Client feature requests changing scope.

## Progress & Effort

- **Effort Expended**: Planning in tandem with improved AI pipeline.
- **Future Estimate**: Very short once tools ready.
- **Current Status**: Awaiting tool readiness.

## Next Steps & Recommendations

Execute as soon as pipeline confirmed stable, deliver quickly, iterate based on
feedback.

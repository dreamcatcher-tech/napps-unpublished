# S32-map-tasks-dependencies-and-risks.md

## Stuck ID & Name

- **ID**: S32
- **Name**: map-tasks-dependencies-and-risks

## Rationale

Clear dependency mapping and risk identification helps manage complexity,
ensuring proactive resource allocation and strategic planning.

## Description

Construct a dependency graph of tasks, identify risks, and provide this map to
the Commander and stakeholders, aiding in scheduling and prioritization.

## Context & References

- **Transcripts**: (19:04, 26:09, 28:16) highlight need for better planning,
  risk assessment.
- **Domains/Definitions**: Stuck schema (S16), Commander logic (S25).
- **External References**: Project management risk mapping techniques.

## Dependencies

- **Stuck Dependencies**: S16 for structured tasks, S25 for Commander
  integration.
- **Resource/Domain Dependencies**: Task data and known dependencies.

## Desired Outcome (Definition of Done)

A comprehensive task map with dependencies and identified risks, validated by
Commander using it for improved scheduling and fewer surprises.

## QA/Evals

- **Tests & Verifications**:
  - Check correctness of mapped dependencies.
  - Simulate risk scenarios.
- **Metrics for Success**:
  - Better strategic decisions, reduced missed dependencies.

## Tasks & Key Functionalities

- **Subtasks**:
  1. Extract and record dependencies
  2. Assign risk levels
  3. Provide a visualization or data structure for Commander
- **Capabilities Needed**: Dependency graph generation, risk scoring logic.

## Constraints & Risks

- **Known Limitations**: Requires stable stuck structure.
- **Potential Risks**: Risk models may evolve over time.

## Progress & Effort

- **Effort Expended**: Conceptual phase.
- **Future Estimate**: 1 sprint after Commander functional.
- **Current Status**: Awaiting foundational structures.

## Next Steps & Recommendations

Implement once main Commander functions stable, start with a simple dependency
map and refine risk assessments iteratively.

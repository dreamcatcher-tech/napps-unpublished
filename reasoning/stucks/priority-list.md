# Updated Priority List

Below is a revised integrated priority list that merges all known Stucks
(S1–S42). This list reflects near-term deliverables (e.g., the Trucking App),
foundational infrastructure (NApps, Artifact, repository unification),
complexity management (Commander AI), and newly proposed items (Gantt charts,
interface summaries, monthly reports). We have elevated certain Stucks that, if
done earlier, could yield quicker or more efficient outcomes—such as **S36**
(using advanced AI for the Trucking App), **S19** (automating O1 code
generation), and **S21** (auto-updating Commander on commits).

### Summary

1. **Commander** (S25) and **Trucking App** (S24) remain top priorities, along
   with the essentials for stable NApp formats (S8), robust stuck structures
   (S27), and the foundational Git-based Artifact (S1).
2. **Repository unification** (S28) and **stuck assignment** (S33) follow
   closely to reduce fragmentation and formalize the workflow.
3. **Quality Assurance** (S38) closes out the immediate critical set to
   guarantee we’re controlling complexity as features scale.
4. We’ve promoted **S36** (advanced AI for the Trucking App), **S19** (automated
   O1 codegen), and **S21** (auto-updates on commits) higher than before,
   recognizing that doing them sooner can yield quicker gains in velocity and
   synergy between Commander and code.
5. The rest of the Stucks keep a similar tiered approach, ensuring we
   systematically tackle both near-term enhancements and longer-term expansions.

This ordering aims to meet urgent deliverables, establish robust infrastructure,
and harness improved AI workflows early, thereby accelerating outcomes and
ensuring the project evolves cohesively.

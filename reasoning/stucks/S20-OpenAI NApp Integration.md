## Stuck ID & Name

- **ID**: S20
- **Name**: openai-napp-integration

## Rationale

Integrate OpenAI models as a NApp for reasoning, content generation, and tool
usage, expanding AI capabilities within the platform.

## Description

A NApp that sends prompts to OpenAI, receives responses, and leverages tool
calls, enhancing system intelligence.

## Context & References

- **Transcripts**: Discussed adding powerful AI features.
- **Domains/Definitions**: NApp execution environment, tool call interfaces.
- **External References**: OpenAI API docs.

## Dependencies

- **Stuck Dependencies**: NApp format stable (S8) helps integration.
- **Resource/Domain Dependencies**: OpenAI API credentials and stable network
  access.

## Desired Outcome (Definition of Done)

NApp can send prompts to OpenAI, get coherent responses, and integrate tool
usage. Tests confirm correct response handling.

## QA/Evals

- **Tests & Verifications**:
  - Test queries, measure response quality, check tool calls.
- **Metrics for Success**:
  - High response coherence, stable integration with no errors.

## Tasks & Key Functionalities

- **Subtasks**:
  1. OpenAI API calls
  2. Response parsing
  3. Tool call integration
- **Capabilities Needed**: API handling, JSON parsing, error management.

## Constraints & Risks

- **Known Limitations**: API costs, latency.
- **Potential Risks**: Future API changes.

## Progress & Effort

- **Effort Expended**: Some testing with APIs.
- **Future Estimate**: 1 sprint basic version.
- **Current Status**: Prototyping begun.

## Next Steps & Recommendations

Implement minimal functionality, test basic prompts, then expand tool usage
gradually.

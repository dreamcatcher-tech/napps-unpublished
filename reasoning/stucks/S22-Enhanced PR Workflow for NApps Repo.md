# S22-enhanced-pr-workflow-for-napps-repo.md

## Stuck ID & Name

- **ID**: S22
- **Name**: enhanced-pr-workflow-for-napps-repo

## Rationale

A smoother PR process with automated checks, CI/CD, and code reviews ensures
higher code quality and fewer regressions in NApp development.

## Description

Enhance the PR workflow by adding automated tests, lint checks, and review
steps, merging only when checks pass.

## Context & References

- **Transcripts**: Mentioned to improve collaboration and code quality.
- **Domains/Definitions**: Ties into CI/CD pipelines and repository maintenance.
- **External References**: GitHub Actions, common CI/CD practices.

## Dependencies

- **Stuck Dependencies**: Unified repo (S28) might help streamline checks.
- **Resource/Domain Dependencies**: Test suites, lint rules, and stable CI
  tools.

## Desired Outcome (Definition of Done)

PRs trigger automated checks, code merges only occur after passing QA steps.
Confirmed by testing sample PRs and seeing consistent results.

## QA/Evals

- **Tests & Verifications**:
  - Submit sample PRs, confirm tests run automatically.
- **Metrics for Success**:
  - Reduced defects, positive dev feedback on CI flow.

## Tasks & Key Functionalities

- **Subtasks**:
  1. Add CI scripts (lint, test)
  2. Integrate with GitHub Actions or similar
  3. Validate workflow on sample PRs
- **Capabilities Needed**: CI/CD integration, automated test coverage.

## Constraints & Risks

- **Known Limitations**: CI might slow merges slightly.
- **Potential Risks**: Edge cases in testing.

## Progress & Effort

- **Effort Expended**: Basic CI setup attempted.
- **Future Estimate**: <1 sprint to refine pipeline.
- **Current Status**: Initial CI scripts exist.

## Next Steps & Recommendations

Add automated tests, integrate actions, refine workflow as needed.

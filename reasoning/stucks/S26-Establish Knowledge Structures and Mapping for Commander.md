# S26-establish-knowledge-structures-and-mapping-for-commander.md

## Stuck ID & Name

- **ID**: S26
- **Name**: establish-knowledge-structures-and-mapping-for-commander

## Rationale

Commander needs well-defined knowledge frameworks to handle data, tasks, and
dependencies. Without it, reasoning fails.

## Description

Define hierarchical and graph-based knowledge structures so the Commander can
navigate data efficiently and make informed decisions.

## Context & References

- **Transcripts**: (33:07, 34:40, 39:54, 42:05, 44:50) emphasize structured
  knowledge.
- **Domains/Definitions**: Ties into stuck definitions, domain narratives.
- **External References**: Ontology/knowledge graph best practices.

## Dependencies

- **Stuck Dependencies**: S28 (unify repos) for easy access to definitions, S16
  (stuck schema).
- **Resource/Domain Dependencies**: Well-structured domain definitions.

## Desired Outcome (Definition of Done)

Knowledge structures in place, Commander queries run efficiently, tests show
Commander can find and use relevant info quickly.

## QA/Evals

- **Tests & Verifications**:
  - Test Commander queries under structured knowledge.
- **Metrics for Success**:
  - Reduced confusion, faster Commander responses.

## Tasks & Key Functionalities

- **Subtasks**:
  1. Implement hierarchical storage
  2. Index and link domain concepts
  3. Test with sample queries
- **Capabilities Needed**: Indexing, graph queries.

## Constraints & Risks

- **Known Limitations**: Needs stable schemas.
- **Potential Risks**: Adapting structure as project evolves.

## Progress & Effort

- **Effort Expended**: Conceptual design in progress.
- **Future Estimate**: 1-2 sprints for initial setup.
- **Current Status**: Preliminary schema proposals.

## Next Steps & Recommendations

Implement after Commanderâ€™s basic framework, refine iteratively as project
scales.

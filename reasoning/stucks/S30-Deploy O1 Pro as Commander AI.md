# S30-deploy-o1-pro-as-commander-ai.md

## Stuck ID & Name

- **ID**: S30
- **Name**: deploy-o1-pro-as-commander-ai

## Rationale

O1 Pro can serve as the core AI for command and control, orchestrating tasks,
decisions, and resource allocation, enhancing autonomy and scaling without
linear human effort.

## Description

Integrate O1 Pro as the Commander AI, enabling it to use tool calls, structured
outputs, and continuously update plans based on the project's state.

## Context & References

- **Transcripts**: Mentioned to achieve a fully integrated AI-driven project
  manager (18:00).
- **Domains/Definitions**: Commander concepts from S25.
- **External References**: AI orchestration best practices.

## Dependencies

- **Stuck Dependencies**: S25 (Commander), stable environment from S28 (unify
  repo), S26 (knowledge structures).
- **Resource/Domain Dependencies**: O1 Pro API access, stable tool call
  interfaces.

## Desired Outcome (Definition of Done)

O1 Pro integrated as Commander AI, tested by improved decision loops, reduced
manual overhead, and consistent task management outputs.

## QA/Evals

- **Tests & Verifications**:
  - Trigger decision cycles, measure improvements in workflow.
- **Metrics for Success**:
  - Better strategic outcomes, positive feedback on reduced manual intervention.

## Tasks & Key Functionalities

- **Subtasks**:
  1. Connect O1 Pro to Commander logic
  2. Test decision loops and tool usage
  3. Fine-tune prompts if needed
- **Capabilities Needed**: O1 integration, tool invocation framework.

## Constraints & Risks

- **Known Limitations**: Requires stable Commander and tool integration.
- **Potential Risks**: Prompt tuning challenges.

## Progress & Effort

- **Effort Expended**: Preliminary integration ideas only.
- **Future Estimate**: Several sprints after infrastructure ready.
- **Current Status**: Planning phase.

## Next Steps & Recommendations

Integrate O1 Pro post-Commander stabilization, incrementally test decision loops
and refine.

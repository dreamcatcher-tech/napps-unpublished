## Stuck ID & Name

- **ID**: S34
- **Name**: develop-module-mapping-system

## Rationale

As projects scale into multiple packages, a mapping system for modules in NApps
ensures easy navigation, integration, and maintenance.

## Description

Create a system to track and relate modules across NApps, enabling the Commander
and developers to find and integrate modules smoothly.

## Context & References

- **Transcripts**: (21:00) references complexity in module-level organization.
- **Domains/Definitions**: NApp schema (S8), Commander logic (S25).
- **External References**: Modular architecture patterns.

## Dependencies

- **Stuck Dependencies**: S8 for NApp format, stable stuck structure.
- **Resource/Domain Dependencies**: Access to codebase to identify modules.

## Desired Outcome (Definition of Done)

A module mapping system that identifies modules, their dependencies, and
versions, tested by easy module lookups and fewer integration errors.

## QA/Evals

- **Tests & Verifications**:
  - Test module lookups, verify correct dependency chains.
- **Metrics for Success**:
  - Faster development, fewer integration issues.

## Tasks & Key Functionalities

- **Subtasks**:
  1. Module registry creation
  2. Dependency mapping per module
  3. UI or CLI queries for modules
- **Capabilities Needed**: Module discovery, dependency graphing.

## Constraints & Risks

- **Known Limitations**: Requires stable code organization.
- **Potential Risks**: Growing complexity as modules increase.

## Progress & Effort

- **Effort Expended**: Concept phase.
- **Future Estimate**: 1 sprint after task structures stable.
- **Current Status**: Awaiting prerequisites.

## Next Steps & Recommendations

Implement once stucks and Commander well-defined, start with a few modules and
scale as needed.

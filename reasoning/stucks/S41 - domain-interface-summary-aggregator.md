# S41 - domain-interface-summary-aggregator

## Priority & Rationale

**Priority**: Medium\
**Rationale**: Multiple domains have overlapping concepts, and the Commander
needs a clear, unified view to make informed decisions. A Domain Interface
Summary Aggregator (NApp or tool) will reconcile definitions and create concise
summaries of where domains intersect, reducing confusion and aiding strategic
planning.

## Description

Develop a tool that scans domains, definitions, and interfaces, identifying
overlaps and producing a consolidated "interface summary." This summary
highlights key terms, their inter-domain relationships, and any conflicting
definitions, enabling the Commander and stakeholders to navigate complex
conceptual terrain.

## Context & References

- **Transcripts**:
  - References to confusion over domain overlaps in recent discussions (e.g.,
    2024-12-04 reasoning domains and interfaces), where users noted the need for
    clarity.
- **Domains/Definitions**:
  - Relevant to `domains/innovation/*`, `domains/commander/*`, and any domain
    with multiple related definitions.
- **External References**:
  - Similar to ontology alignment or data integration in semantic web contexts.

## Dependencies

- **Stuck Dependencies**:
  - S28 (Unify Code and Knowledge Repositories) to ensure all domain definitions
    are easily accessible in one place.
  - S26 (Establish Knowledge Structures and Mapping for Commander) for reliable
    domain references.
- **Resource/Domain Dependencies**:
  - Requires stable, well-formed definitions in each domain folder.

## Desired Outcome (Definition of Done)

- A generated summary of domain interfaces that:
  1. Lists overlapping terms and concepts clearly.
  2. Identifies areas of conceptual redundancy or conflict.
  3. Is updated periodically or on-demand.
- Verification that the Commander (and possibly other agents) can use this
  summary to resolve domain queries more efficiently.

## QA/Evals

- **Tests & Verifications**:
  - Provide multiple domain definitions and check if the aggregator identifies
    shared concepts correctly.
  - Introduce conflicting definitions and see if the tool flags them.
- **Metrics for Success**:
  - Reduction in Commander’s requests for clarifications (if tracked).
  - Positive feedback from stakeholders on clarity gained.

## Tasks & Key Functionalities

- **Subtasks**:
  1. Implement a parser to scan domain folders for definitions.
  2. Create logic to detect similar terms (based on naming, links, or semantic
     hints).
  3. Generate a single summary document or NApp output that lists intersections.
  4. Highlight conflicts or ambiguities with suggestions for resolution.
- **Capabilities Needed**:
  - Natural language or simple semantic analysis.
  - Ability to link to original definitions for reference.

## Constraints & Risks

- **Known Limitations**:
  - Might require initial manual curation if definitions aren’t standardized.
- **Potential Risks**:
  - Inconsistent naming conventions across domains may reduce the accuracy of
    automated matching.
  - Performance or complexity if many domains and definitions exist.

## Progress & Effort

- **Effort Expended**:
  - None yet; concept stage.
- **Future Estimate**:
  - Approximately 1 sprint for a minimal viable aggregator.
- **Current Status**:
  - “Planned”: awaiting stable unified repository (S28) and finalized domain
    structures.

## Next Steps & Recommendations

- Ensure domain definitions follow a consistent pattern (naming, linking).
- Build a prototype aggregator and test with a subset of domains.
- Refine logic based on early results and stakeholder feedback.

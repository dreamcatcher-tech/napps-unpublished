## Stuck ID & Name

- **ID**: S38
- **Name**:
  implement-quality-assurance-qa-processes-to-control-complexity-and-costs

## Rationale

As complexity and speed increase, QA processes prevent accumulating defects and
tech debt, ensuring stable growth and controlled costs.

## Description

Integrate QA into workflows: automated testing, code reviews, performance
checks. Merge only stable, verified changes to maintain high-quality output.

## Context & References

- **Transcripts**: (33:07, 34:40, 39:54, 42:05, 44:50) highlight the need for
  controlling complexity and ensuring quality.
- **Domains/Definitions**: Integrates with CI/CD and NApp pipelines.
- **External References**: Standard QA frameworks, unit/integration tests.

## Dependencies

- **Stuck Dependencies**: Unified repo (S28) to run consistent QA checks.
- **Resource/Domain Dependencies**: Test suites, lint rules, stable toolchains.

## Desired Outcome (Definition of Done)

QA integrated, preventing regressions and improving code quality. Tests confirm
defect rates drop, stable deployments increase.

## QA/Evals

- **Tests & Verifications**:
  - Check code quality metrics, defect rates pre/post QA.
- **Metrics for Success**:
  - Reduced rework, stable release cycles.

## Tasks & Key Functionalities

- **Subtasks**:
  1. Set up automated tests and lint checks
  2. Integrate into CI/CD pipeline
  3. Monitor code quality metrics
- **Capabilities Needed**: Testing frameworks, CI integration.

## Constraints & Risks

- **Known Limitations**: Requires stable main repo and task structures.
- **Potential Risks**: QA tools may need refinement as complexity grows.

## Progress & Effort

- **Effort Expended**: Initial QA concepts identified.
- **Future Estimate**: 1-2 sprints for initial QA pipeline.
- **Current Status**: Ready to integrate once tasks stable.

## Next Steps & Recommendations

Implement QA early to prevent tech debt, expand test coverage incrementally.

# S6-web-to-artifact-auth-bridge.md

## Stuck ID & Name

- **ID**: S6
- **Name**: web-to-artifact-auth-bridge

## Rationale

Maintain a trusted chain of authentication from the web UI to the Artifact
layer, ensuring user-level permissions are respected end-to-end.

## Description

After Privy-based web auth, securely pass authenticated credentials to Artifact
so that only authorized requests succeed.

## Context & References

- **Transcripts**: Implied need for secure pipeline.
- **Domains/Definitions**: Authentication and artifact access rules.
- **External References**: Token exchange protocols, secure bridging methods.

## Dependencies

- **Stuck Dependencies**: S5 (Privy auth) for initial user authentication.
- **Resource/Domain Dependencies**: Stable artifact auth model.

## Desired Outcome (Definition of Done)

Web-authenticated sessions produce tokens recognized by Artifact, ensuring that
Artifact operations require valid user creds.

## QA/Evals

- **Tests & Verifications**: Verify only authenticated requests reach Artifact,
  check token integrity.
- **Metrics for Success**: 100% authenticated calls succeed, unauthorized fail.

## Tasks & Key Functionalities

- **Subtasks**:
  1. Implement token exchange or passing mechanism
  2. Auth middleware at Artifact layer
  3. Test with sample requests
- **Capabilities Needed**: Secure token handling, request signing.

## Constraints & Risks

- **Known Limitations**: Requires stable artifact auth integration.
- **Potential Risks**: Handling token expiration, refresh flows.

## Progress & Effort

- **Effort Expended**: Conceptual token flow design.
- **Future Estimate**: ~1 sprint to implement/test.
- **Current Status**: Planning.

## Next Steps & Recommendations

Establish a standardized token/key exchange, test with sample requests, refine
as needed.

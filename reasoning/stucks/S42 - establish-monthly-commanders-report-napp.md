# S42 - establish-monthly-commanders-report-napp

## Priority & Rationale

**Priority**: Medium\
**Rationale**: Stakeholders and external parties benefit from periodic,
human-readable summaries of progress, priorities, and outcomes. A monthly
Commander’s Report NApp streamlines this communication, reduces manual overhead,
and ensures transparency and consistency in reporting.

## Description

Create an NApp or workflow that, on a set schedule (e.g., monthly), compiles
project data from the Commander’s records (stucks, priorities, achievements),
and outputs a concise, stakeholder-friendly report. This report can include
highlights of completed stucks, upcoming priorities, risk assessments, and other
strategic insights.

## Context & References

- **Transcripts**:
  - Motivated by references to stakeholder communication in recent transcripts
    (e.g., 2024-12-20 project management first stucks review) where consistent
    reporting was discussed.
- **Domains/Definitions**:
  - Related to Commander domain (`domains/commander/`) and stuck management
    (`domains/innovation/stuck.md`).
- **External References**:
  - Common project management practices (e.g., monthly executive summaries).

## Dependencies

- **Stuck Dependencies**:
  - S25 (Commander AI for Complexity Management) to provide accurate data.
  - S27 (Robust Task Structure) to ensure well-defined stuck status.
- **Resource/Domain Dependencies**:
  - Access to unified code/knowledge base (S28) so all info is readily
    available.

## Desired Outcome (Definition of Done)

- A generated monthly report that:
  1. Summarizes top priorities and recently resolved stucks.
  2. Highlights upcoming deliverables and potential risks.
  3. Is easily accessible to stakeholders (e.g., as a text file, PDF, or
     dashboard).
- Verification that at least one monthly cycle runs successfully and feedback is
  positive.

## QA/Evals

- **Tests & Verifications**:
  - Run a test “mock month-end” scenario using sample data.
  - Check correctness of included stuck updates, ensuring no outdated info.
  - Solicit feedback from at least one stakeholder to confirm utility and
    clarity.
- **Metrics for Success**:
  - Reduction in ad-hoc stakeholder queries.
  - Positive stakeholder feedback on clarity and usefulness.

## Tasks & Key Functionalities

- **Subtasks**:
  1. Implement data retrieval from Commander’s records.
  2. Summarize changes since last report (e.g., resolved stucks, new
     priorities).
  3. Format the output in a stakeholder-friendly manner (markdown, HTML, or
     PDF).
  4. Schedule the report generation (e.g., via cron or a trigger command).
- **Capabilities Needed**:
  - Ability to pull stuck statuses, priorities, and timelines from Commander’s
    data.
  - Simple templating for report formatting.

## Constraints & Risks

- **Known Limitations**:
  - Initial reports may be basic; formatting and detail level can improve over
    time.
- **Potential Risks**:
  - If Commander’s data is incomplete or inconsistent, report quality suffers.
  - Scaling to very large sets of stucks may require pagination or summaries.

## Progress & Effort

- **Effort Expended**:
  - None yet; idea stage.
- **Future Estimate**:
  - About 1 sprint to set up a minimal version of the monthly report.
- **Current Status**:
  - “Planned”: waiting on stable Commander operations (S25) and task structure
    (S27).

## Next Steps & Recommendations

- Ensure Commander provides consistent stuck metadata.
- Implement a prototype report focusing on the most critical stuck updates.
- Gather stakeholder feedback and iterate on formatting and content depth.

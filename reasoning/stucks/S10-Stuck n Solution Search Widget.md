# S10-stuck-solution-search-widget.md

## Stuck ID & Name

- **ID**: S10
- **Name**: stuck-solution-search-widget

## Rationale

Quickly finding stucks and solutions speeds project management, allowing instant
reference to known issues/fixes.

## Description

Extend the live search widget to query stuck/solution data, returning relevant
entries instantly on user input.

## Context & References

- **Transcripts**: Analogous to customer search widget logic.
- **Domains/Definitions**: Requires stuck data indexing.
- **External References**: Indexed search techniques.

## Dependencies

- **Stuck Dependencies**: Stable stuck storage (S16).
- **Resource/Domain Dependencies**: Data must be indexed and queryable.

## Desired Outcome (Definition of Done)

User queries yield immediate stuck/solution listings, improving efficiency in
resolving issues.

## QA/Evals

- **Tests & Verifications**: Test queries, validate speed/accuracy.
- **Metrics for Success**: Low latency, high relevance.

## Tasks & Key Functionalities

- **Subtasks**:
  1. Integrate stuck/solution dataset into search index
  2. Adapt UI for these results
- **Capabilities Needed**: Efficient indexing, UI integration.

## Constraints & Risks

- **Known Limitations**: Depends on stable stuck data.
- **Potential Risks**: Handling large stuck sets efficiently.

## Progress & Effort

- **Effort Expended**: Concept only.
- **Future Estimate**: <1 sprint once data stable.
- **Current Status**: Pending stuck data integration.

## Next Steps & Recommendations

After stuck data stable, point widget to that dataset, test and refine.

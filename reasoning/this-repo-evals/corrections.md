# Corrections

These are common transcription corrections based on the terminology defined in
**[gold-tasks.md](gold-tasks.md)**:

1. **Replace all instances of `NAP` with `napp` (lowercase).**
   - _Example:_
     - Before: _"Build the Reasoner workbench as a **NAP** (Networked AI
       Process)."_
     - After: _"Build the Reasoner workbench as a **napp** (Natural Language
       App)."_

2. **Replace all instances of `NAPs` with `napps` (lowercase).**
   - _Example:_
     - Before: _"Build **NAPs** that support the render loop, including
       different types of renders..."_
     - After: _"Build **napps** that support the render loop, including
       different types of renders..."_

3. **Replace `NAP format` with `napp format`.**
   - _Example:_
     - Before: _"Modify the **NAP format** to handle stucks and potentially
       adjust it."_
     - After: _"Modify the **napp format** to handle stucks and potentially
       adjust it."_

4. **Standardize `Dream Catcher` to `Dreamcatcher Network` throughout the
   document.**
   - _Example:_
     - Before: _"Capture and refine the context diagram, including all
       dimensions and components of the **Dream Catcher** system."_
     - After: _"Capture and refine the context diagram, including all dimensions
       and components of the **Dreamcatcher Network**."_

5. **Review and correct pluralization and grammatical issues.**
   - Verify the usage of terms like `stucks`; if `stuck` is the preferred term,
     adjust accordingly.
   - Ensure singular and plural forms are used correctly throughout the tasks.

6. **Ensure file names are in kebab case.**
   - All file names should be in kebab case. E.g. `todays-tasks.md`
   - All file names should be in lowercase.
   - README files and SUMMARY files are an exception; they should be capitalized
     as “README.md” and “SUMMARY.md” respectively.

7. **Spelling Standard:**
   - Use American English spelling throughout the repository, even if it differs
     from the original usage.

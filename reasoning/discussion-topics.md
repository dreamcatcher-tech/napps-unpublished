1. repo rules should go into the definitions of the commander.

2. The concept of a key set of generated files that get updated when new
   information changes, which is an architectural patten:

> The core structure of the project is maintained by a set of key files, each
> backed by a “reasons to change” document. These documents define the purpose
> and the conditions under which their associated files should be updated. When
> new information—such as a transcript or data feed—arrives, the system inspects
> each file against its “reasons to change.” If conditions are met, the file is
> updated accordingly, ensuring that the project’s foundational materials remain
> accurate and relevant.

> This update process is not isolated. Each file’s change may trigger downstream
> modifications in related artifacts—such as tasks, reports, or other project
> management docs—that depend on the altered file. By systematically cascading
> updates through the network of related files, the process ensures that each
> piece of input data propagates consistently, maintaining a coherent and fully
> synchronized project state.

3. define what the name is of the type of rule that makes new rules, like a
   subprocess in the commander

4. How can I get a prize from the commander ? like a medal or a badge of honour
   ? and how can I be punished for not doing the recommended actions ?

5. define consensus level stucks, things that we quickly need to reach agreement
   on, since this affects the smooth flow of communications, such as defining
   what a solution is, how I would split some stucks, or merge them, and the
   same with solutions, plus indicate expected solution delivery, like non napp,
   new napp, or patched napp.

6. where to insert goals, and justifications of those goals, so they are well
   reasoned ? for example, figuring out consensus is important, but where should
   that rank ? how can we account for the pattern of seeing how to do it so its
   easy right away, vs labouring hard just because I was told it was time ? The
   difference between opportunity and discipline.

7. Automated GitHub Issue Resolution System

8. concentrate on getting house rules correct and a process for optimizing, so
   we can continue on efficiently.

9. Additional house rules:
   - use key words to indicate that you have finished speaking and that the llm
     should start processing

10. what is the name of the platform we are making - the base ui - the most
    general of interfaces ?

11. need to get more formal in capturing the ideas and lessons that Smax learns
    from all his toil with the AI

12. A stuck needed to be made to cover the provisioning of the local environment
    suitable to pull from Moneyworks and run the web app / api, reporting on
    that process, restart on computer restart, restart on failure, logging for
    capturing faults.

13. xml extraction requires a compilation of the moneyworks docs into a format
    that is digested by the AI.

14. multiple angles of extraction - this still is not being approached correctly

15. So basically context grabbing is a big enough deal that we probably need
    that to be a core feature of our platform - the more you can get, and share,
    and the easier it is, the more useful the LLMs. The software should be
    entirely free, the tokens near free, but the trade that is faciliated should
    be skimmed. So we should be building things that grab context, as the
    strategic stuck.

16. Naming different types of stuck, like the stuck that is the most important,
    and the stuck that is the most urgent, and the stuck that is the most
    important and urgent. Horizon Stuck (furthest attainable), Moon Stuck
    (furthest desired), burning stuck (most urgent).

17. A changing of thinking that we need to be very deliberate and aware about,
    how we are conditioned to think as tho code and admin costs effort. For
    example, I threw away perfectly good code today, which one would never
    normally do.

18. o1-pro rules - cannot seem to ignore data in a file, and cannot ignore files
    in context provided, so need to narrow the context automatically.

19. what is it like to have a team of AI boosted people working on a large
    project ? what is that large project ? How much can one person handle ? how
    does heirarchy work, if at all ? How would this relate to running a country
    ?

20. need to get the math formulas of the dreamcatcher specified

21. whatsapp messages get dropped - points made here are lossy

22. I see no math models from SMax, so has this skill not bee passed over ?

23. deliverability format of the formulas of the dreamcatcher - their purpose is
    to define the way the key algorithm holds together, with different modules
    being used for different intelligence portions of the algorithm, such as
    fairness calculations, adjustment. These should be like PID for servo
    control.

24. how can we make some sample data that can be used to test the dreamcatcher
    formulas against ? How can we use our own data to test the formulas on ?

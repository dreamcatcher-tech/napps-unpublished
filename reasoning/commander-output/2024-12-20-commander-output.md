Below is a revised initial appraisal of the provided Stucks, incorporating known
objectives from the transcripts, domain definitions, and READMEs. This set
includes references to the directory structure, domain definitions, and
transcripts, as well as suggested priorities that align with near-term
deliverables (e.g., delivering the trucking app), foundational infrastructure
(NApps, Artifact), and strategic enablers (the Commander for complexity
management).

Each Stuck now includes:

- A brief description
- References to pertinent domains and transcripts
- Dependencies or prerequisites if known
- Proposed priority and approximate AI token/time estimate

This is an initial pass. Further refinement will occur as we integrate more
data, feedback, and progress updates.

### Next Steps

- Validate these proposed priorities and dependencies with the user or
  stakeholders.
- Confirm estimates and adjust as new data arrives.
- Begin with top-tier Stucks (e.g., Commander development S25, deliver trucking
  app S24, standardizing NApps S8, implementing stuck structure S27).
- Continuously update this list as transcripts, domain definitions, and user
  feedback refine objectives.

This initial appraisal sets a roadmap for methodically tackling Stucks, ensuring
we focus first on strategic alignment, logical necessity, and near-term value
creation.

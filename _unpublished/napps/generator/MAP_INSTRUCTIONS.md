# Project Map Instructions

**Purpose:**\
`MAP.txt` provides a high-level map of the projectâ€™s structure, purpose, and key
components. It helps new contributors quickly understand the overall layout and
logic without too much detail.

**Key Rules:**

- Start at `ðŸ“¦ /`.
- Organize top-level folders and files first, with important items at the top.
- Place `dependencies` at the bottom, with `vendor-docs` above it if it exists.
- Notation:
  - `ðŸ“¦` for the root project
  - `ðŸ“‚` for directories
  - `ðŸ“„` for files
  - `ðŸ§©` for dependent projects
- Under each file, list:
  - Exported functions for code files, including their TS parameter/return
    types. Do not include functions that are not exported.
  - Top-level headings for knowledge files such as markdown documents.
  - All tests for test files using the description of the test, but only the top
    level tests. Do not include sub-steps inside the test. Tests do not need an
    info note due to the description of the test being informative enough.
- Add a short rationale note (`â„¹`) beneath each item.
- Skip files that aren't architecturally important. These are files that could
  be replaced without materially affecting the project's core structure or
  purpose. Architecturally important files are those that:
  - Shape the system's overall design or domain logic
  - Define core functionality
  - Handle critical flows
  - Directly influence how components are structured or interact
- Exclude `MAP.txt` from its own map.
- Exclude `vendor-docs` details deeper than just the folder names, as the
  details are not within our control, being vendor supplied..
- Never mention anything about any files that have been omitted from the map.
- always use kebab-case for file names except for top level .md files like
  README.md
- test filenames must follow the format `<name>.test.<extension>`
- dependencies are pulled out from the deno.json file and a primarily used to
  link relevant vendor-docs documentation to the usage of the vendor module.

**Example Map:**

```text
ðŸ“¦ /
â”œâ”€ ðŸ“‚ src
â”‚  â”œâ”€ ðŸ“„ main.ts
â”‚  â”‚   â„¹ Entry point for CLI
â”‚  â”‚   1. runCLI(args: string[]): Promise<number>
â”‚  â”‚      â„¹ Parses CLI arguments, executes workflow, returns exit code
â”‚  â”œâ”€ ðŸ“„ utils.ts
â”‚  â”‚   â„¹ Shared utilities
â”‚  â”‚   1. formatOutput(input: string): string
â”‚  â”‚      â„¹ Formats CLI output for readability
â”‚  â”‚   2. handleError(error: Error): void
â”‚  â”‚      â„¹ Centralized error handling
â”œâ”€ ðŸ“‚ tests
â”‚  â”œâ”€ ðŸ“„ main.test.ts
â”‚  â”‚   â„¹ Tests runCLI()
â”‚  â”‚   1. CLI runs with Valid args
â”‚  â”‚   2. CLI runs with Invalid args
â”‚  â”œâ”€ ðŸ“„ utils.test.ts
â”‚  â”‚   â„¹ Tests utils.ts functions
â”‚  â”‚   1. Correct string formatting
â”‚  â”‚   2. Logs error details as expected
â”œâ”€ ðŸ“„ README.md
â”‚   â„¹ Quick start and top-level overview
â”‚   1. Introduction
â”‚   â”‚  â„¹ Brief project summary
â”‚   2. Installation
â”‚   â”‚  â„¹ Setup steps
â”‚   3. Usage
â”‚      â„¹ Basic runtime instructions
â”œâ”€ ðŸ“‚ vendor-docs
â”‚  â„¹ External dependency documentation
â”‚  â””â”€ ðŸ“„ commander/
â”‚     â„¹ Docs for the `commander` CLI library
â””â”€ ðŸ“‚ dependencies
   â”œâ”€ ðŸ“¦ @babel/parser
   â”‚   â„¹ Parses embedded JSON in scripts
   â”œâ”€ ðŸ“¦ commander
   â”‚   â„¹ CLI argument parsing library
   â””â”€ ðŸ§© subproject1
       â„¹ Integrated dependent project
```

**Why This Format?**

- Using `â„¹` notes and uniform structure allows automated extraction and
  filtering of both structural and rationale information.
- Explicit TS types for functions clarify inputs and outputs.
- Listing all tests under each test file ensures a complete snapshot of the
  projectâ€™s verification points.
- This approach keeps the overview clean, easy to maintain, and useful at any
  level of detail.
